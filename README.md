# Show Spotter

It can be tedious to find where a movie or tv show is available to stream with all the different
streaming services available and the different shows exclusive to each service. We want to
create an easier way for people to find where these shows can be streamed all through one
interface.

# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

### Executive Summary - Show Spotter Study


* Investigated user experiences with streaming services to identify how to improve the process of finding shows.

    * Gathered data to help us figure out current **problems in UI** and **discoverability of shows**

    * Creation of a website to **guide users through UI** or to allow them to **search for certain shows**, returning up-to-date **info on where the show is currently streaming**.

* **Online Questionnaire** of our class (n = 17) for quantitative data on how people use streaming services.
    * **41.2%** are subscribed to **3-4 streaming services**


* **Interviews** of our class (n = 4) for qualitative data for unique experiences of using streaming services.
    * Users interested in our service use **streaming almost exclusively**
    * People dislike how some streaming **services are unstructured** with **differing categories on the homepage**.
