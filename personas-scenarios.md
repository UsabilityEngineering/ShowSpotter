# Scenarios

## (A) Mike overhears about a cool show.
While Mike was in the dugout during his baseball game, he overheard some spectators talking about a new show they’ve been watching that interested him. He heard them say the name of the show but isn’t sure where you can watch it. When he gets home later he wants to see if it is on one of the streaming services he owns. 

## (B) Sarah's binge watching was cut short. 
Sarah was watching a new cooking competition show that she really liked but found out that the streaming service she was using only has the first two seasons available. She wants to see she can continue the show on a different service and to see how much that will cost.

## (C) Albert wants to start streaming.  
Albert and his wife are not currently subscribed to any streaming services but are in the process of finding out which ones to get in order to watch the shows they want. They are creating a list of shows and want an easy way to see the minimum amount of services they need to subscribe to.
