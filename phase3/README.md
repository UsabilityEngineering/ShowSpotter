## Protocol Overview

### Task 1
*Now, I want you to imagine that you are looking for a new show that was recommended by your friends. Walk me through how you would find the new show on this website and let me know when you have found your preferred show.*

*On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is “Very Difficult” and 5 is “Very Easy” how  would you rate being able to use this website design to accomplish this task? Why?*

We are hoping that this questions lets us gather data on how effective the search tools are to find shows. 

### Task 2
*Imagine you just set up your account and you want to add Hulu to your homepage. You heard from friends that Hulu has really good movies with fight scenes and you want to check some out.*

*On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is “Very Difficult” and 5 is “Very Easy” how  would you rate being able to use this website design to accomplish this task? Why?*

We are hoping that this question lets us gather data on how effective the side bar is for customizing the homepage.

### Wrap-Up
*Now that you have used the website, I want to know more about your impressions of it. Overall, what did you like most about it?*

This question will let us know if there is anything that may need edits and how satisfied the participant is with the website.  

*What did you dislike the most about it?*

This question will give us an idea of what features we may need to change.

*Are there any additional features you would like for it to have?*

This question will give us feedback on what features could be good to add. 

*On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is "Strongly Disliked" and 5 is "Strongly Liked" how  would you rate your experience using the sidebar of the website?  Why?*

This question will lets us know if the side bar is making their experience better or hindering it.

*Now, I’d like to look back at certain parts of the search tool and get your thoughts on them:*

This part of the wrap-up is used to see how useful the search options are.
