*Are there any additional features you would like for it to have?*

This question will give us feedback on what features could be good to add. 

*On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is "Strongly Disliked" and 5 is "Strongly Liked" how  would you rate your experience using the sidebar of the website?  Why?*
