### Task 1

### Task 2
"Imagine you just set up your account and you want to add Hulu to your homepage. You heard from friends that Hulu has really good movies with fight scenes and you want to check some out."

The purpose of this task is to see how difficult it is for the participant to learn how to use the side bar. 

"On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is “Very Difficult” and 5 is “Very Easy” how  would you rate being able to use this website design to accomplish this task? Why?"

We are hoping that this question lets us gather data on how effective the side bar is for customizing the homepage.
