## Protocol Overview

This study is a formative evaluation that will help us make any changes to our website before final release. We are taking a think-aloud approach so we can understand
what the participant is thinking when making their decisions during the test. We are timing the tasks and we are aware that think-aloud will alter the time, but we will still
get a general idea of how long it takes to complete. 

### Background
Our background questions are used to get some data about who our participant is so we can make sure we are getting data from participants with different backgrounds. 

### Task 1
*Now, I want you to imagine that you have two young kids and are looking for an animated show that will make your kids laugh. The services you are subscribed to are Netflix and Amazon Video.*

The purpose of this task is to see how difficult it is for the participant is to search for a show and to see if they use the search filters. 

*On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is “Very Difficult” and 5 is “Very Easy” how  would you rate being able to use this website design to accomplish this task? Why?*

We are hoping that this questions lets us gather data on how effective the search tools are to find shows. 

### Task 2
*Imagine you just set up your account and you want to add Hulu to your homepage. You heard from friends that Hulu has really good movies with fight scenes and you want to check some out.*

The purpose of this task is to see how difficult it is for the participant to learn how to use the side bar. 

*On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is “Very Difficult” and 5 is “Very Easy” how  would you rate being able to use this website design to accomplish this task? Why?*

We are hoping that this question lets us gather data on how effective the side bar is for customizing the homepage.

### Wrap-Up
*Now that you have used the website, I want to know more about your impressions of it. Overall, what did you like most about it?*

This question will let us know if there is anything that may need edits and how satisfied the participant is with the website.  

*What did you dislike the most about it?*

This question will give us an idea of what features we may need to change.

*Are there any additional features you would like for it to have?*

This question will give us feedback on what features could be good to add. 

*On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is "Strongly Disliked" and 5 is "Strongly Liked" how  would you rate your experience using the sidebar of the website?  Why?*

This question will lets us know if the side bar is making their experience better or hindering it.

*Now, I’d like to look back at certain parts of the search tool and get your thoughts on them:*

This part of the wrap-up is used to see how useful the search options are.
