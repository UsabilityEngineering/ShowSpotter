### Artboards and Justifications

Our Login and Create Account pages are standard to what you would see on every other website. We wanted to do something that would be simple and familiar to nearly every user.

We decided that the main page should follow the current heuristic for consistency and standards for streaming services. The reason for this is that we want users to feel 'at home' when they use our service. From our research, we found that the users interested in our service use streaming almost exclusively. The design will feel familiar to them since it follows much of the same layout as the streaming services they would come from. Additionally, some people did not like how unstructured the homepage is on most streaming services. They found it very random, so our homepage has options to pick and rearrange what the structure of the homepage should be.

<p align = "center">Search Page</p>

For the search page, we want the results to be accurate to what the user wants. When first searching, it will take into account the keywords that the user searches for. After the results appear, there are also visible "Refine Search" options on the side. Our website is made to help users find the shows they are looking for so the refine search option makes this process easier for them. Telling whether the user is subscribed to the service helps inform them before they click on the link which helps prevent user error.

After clicking on a show that the user wants to check out, it will bring them to the show page. The show page has a trailer with a big play button so that the user can preview the show. Along with a description of the show, the user can view the ratings and reviews. On the top right, there are buttons that let the user know which services they can watch the show on. The buttons are dependent on which services the user is subscribed to. If the user is subscribed to a service that provides the show, the button will say "Watch Now," but if they are not, the button will say "Check it out on [Service]."

Since this is a draft, not every button is fully functional. To add a category on the side bar, choose Hulu. To add a subcategory to Hulu, choose Action.
