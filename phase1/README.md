# Team Name, Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

## Methods



## Findings



## Conclusions



## Caveats

Our research was not able to find enough users with varying age demographics, since the sample was only from our class. With the interview, we were able to get to know our user a bit better, but we never actually saw them go through the motions of finding a show to watch. They expressed their concerns, and gave rough estimates of how long it takes them to go through UIâ€™s and other things. It might have been better to have some sort of contextual inquiry in order to see how the client actually interacts with their streaming service, and to see if the estimated time they say it takes to find a show is fairly accurate. 

We assumed that most people would be watching their shows through services such as Netflix and Hulu, but did not account for other streaming services like Twitch and YouTube. We found that a decent amount of people like to spend their time on YouTube/Twitch. These options were not on our survey. In the interview we were able to expose this information, and maybe more people would have voted for YouTube on the survey if it was an option.
