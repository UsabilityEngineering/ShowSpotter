#### Curtis Figgins   Rowelle Marino   Luis Orozco


## Executive Summary - Show Spotter Study

* Investigated user experiences with streaming services to identify how to improve the process of finding shows.

* * Gathered data to help us figure out current problems in UI and discoverability of shows

* * Creation of a website to guide users through UI or to allow them to search for certain shows, returning up-to-date info on where the show is currently streaming.

* Online Questionnaire of our class (n = 17) for quantitative data on how people use streaming services.

* Interviews of our class (n = 4) for qualitative data for unique experiences of using streaming services.


* Personas and scenarios

* * Mike, 21, a college student who spends their evenings streaming shows after long days of class

* * Sarah, 27, a homemaker with a child. When their child is asleep, they like to stream reality shows or watch cable.

* * Albert, 76, retired. Enjoys streaming nostalgic shows with his wife, but is not very tech savvy.



## Methods

_Survey_: We chose surveys as one of our methods because it allows us to get lots of quantitative data easily. We can use them to get information about what streaming services people currently use and how they use them.
n = 17

_Interview_: Interviews allow us to ask questions that give us more in-depth answers that can be unique to each individual person and their experiences. This may bring up data that we wouldn’t normally get through just survey questions. 
n = 4



## Findings
Our survey with multiple choice questions, selecting options, and writing short answers supported our research to find how many streaming services personas are subscribed to and how engaged they are to using those services. Our results show about 41.2% are subscribed to 3-4 services that is 7 personas out of 17 who completed our survey. With feedback provided from this survey, we observed how beneducal personas can utilize Show Spotter.

## Conclusions

From our interviews and surveys we found that the users interested in our service use streaming almost exclusively. We’ve decided that we should just focus on movies and shows on streaming services and not including where to find them on cable or DVD. We also found that people don’t like how some streaming services are unstructured with how they show different categories on the homepage. We are going to allow users to customize their homepage with the categories they want and in the order they want. 


## Caveats

Our research was not able to find enough users with varying age demographics, since the sample was only from our class. With the interview, we were able to get to know our user a bit better, but we never actually saw them go through the motions of finding a show to watch. They expressed their concerns, and gave rough estimates of how long it takes them to go through UI’s and other things. It might have been better to have some sort of contextual inquiry in order to see how the client actually interacts with their streaming service, and to see if the estimated time they say it takes to find a show is fairly accurate. 

We assumed that most people would be watching their shows through services such as Netflix and Hulu, but did not account for other streaming services like Twitch and YouTube. We found that a decent amount of people like to spend their time on YouTube/Twitch. These options were not on our survey. In the interview we were able to expose this information, and maybe more people would have voted for YouTube on the survey if it was an option.
